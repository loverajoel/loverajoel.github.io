<span>Hey, I'm Joel.</span><br><br>
Builder. Currently, Product at Cake DeFi. Passionate about problem solving, strategy, building things, and occasionally helping founders. Based in [📍Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore).

I mostly write these texts for myself, to express my thoughts out loud, and share them with friends.
