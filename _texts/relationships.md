# growing relationships: my personal adventure

Three years ago, I moved to Singapore. Starting fresh was exciting but tough. Making new friends and keeping old ones was hard. Life got busy, and I struggled to stay connected.

I tried many ways to fix this. I used apps, calendars, and planning. But nothing worked. They took too much effort and felt forced.

Last year, I made a pledge. I wanted to be better at building relationships. I wished to remember birthdays, care about friends' lives, and be there for family.

Sadly, relationship building doesn't come naturally to me. I knew I needed help. So, I made a list of what the perfect solution should have:

- **Weekly plan**: A list of people to talk to every week, keeping connections fresh and ongoing.
- Time zones: Easily stay in touch with people around the world.
- Custom pace: Change how often I talk to each person based on our connection.
- Simple: A tool that's easy to use and doesn't stress me out.
- Flexible: Adapting to unique relationships and individual preferences for catch-ups, whether it's a long conversation, a text or a casual coffee.
- Delightful: Makes keeping in touch fun and enjoyable.
- 10x ROI: Helps me get better at connecting with others.

Over the holidays, I made the first prototype. It was simple, but it helped. I began talking to friends I hadn't seen in years. I felt lighter, and my new friends noticed my effort. It was working!

The app isn't perfect yet, and there's still a lot to iterate. If you have the same problem and want to get better at building relationships, feel free to join the beta version and let's fix this problem together.
