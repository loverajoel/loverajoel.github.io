# in tech, be a generalist

_(Once a quarter, I consider specialising in a particular domain. Yet, after a few days of contemplation, I always reach the same conclusion. Sharing for my future self)_

No concept in tech is so complex that it demands specialisation. 

With conviction and purpose, you can gain the understanding to build a successful product and business.

View industries as basic problems, not complex systems. Innovate by understanding consumer needs, regardless of industry. Learn from the foundational principles.

Generalists, free from industry biases, challenge norms by offering fresh perspectives.

Being a generalist in tech does not imply a lack of depth, but rather, a breadth of knowledge that allows for innovation. 

When working in tech, embrace the role of a generalist.
