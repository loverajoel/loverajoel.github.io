# in tech, be a generalist

_(Every quarter, I think about specializing in a particular field. However, after a few days of thought, I reach the same conclusion. Reminder for my future self.)_

No concept in tech is so complex that it demands specialisation. 

With conviction and purpose, you can understand how to build a successful product and business.

Consider industries as fundamental problems, not intricate systems. Innovate by understanding consumer needs, irrespective of the industry.

Draw lessons from basic principles.

Generalists, unbiased by industry norms, offer fresh perspectives. Being a tech generalist doesn't mean you lack depth; it means you have broad knowledge that fosters innovation. 

When working in tech, be a generalist.
