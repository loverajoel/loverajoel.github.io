# in tech, be a generalist

_(About once a quarter, I consider specialising in a particular domain. Yet, after a few days of contemplation, I always reach the same conclusion. Sharing for my future self)_

In tech, no concept is so complex that it demands specialisation. 

With conviction and purpose, you can get the understanding to build a successful product and business.  

View industries as basic problems, not complex systems. Innovate by understanding consumer needs, regardless of industry. Learn from the foundational principles.  

Generalists, free from industry biases, offer fresh perspectives, challenging norms. 

Being a generalist in tech does not imply a lack of depth, but rather, a breadth of knowledge that allows for innovation. 

When working in tech, embrace being a generalist.
