# my all-time favorite books

This page lists my all time favorite books. There are no specific criteria for choosing them, but I find myself recommending them to friends, colleagues, and family time and time again. This page will constantly be updated as I read more.
<br>
<br>

[**Managing Oneself, Peter F. Drucker**](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Oneself-Harvard-Business-Classics/dp/142212312X). The book is packed with wise advice on how to manage your career and rise to the top. The world we live in is filled with unprecedented opportunities, but opportunity carries responsibility, and it's up to you to choose your career path and to change it when necessary. A must-read for career-minded individuals.

[**Pitch Anything, Oren Klaff**](https://www.amazon.com/Pitch-Anything-Innovative-Presenting-Persuading/dp/0071752854). In this book, Oren shares theories on how social interaction works, as well as frames(aka tactics) you can use to change your social status within a social setting. I've read it three times now. I never get tired of recommending this book to my colleagues who attend several stakeholder meetings every week. It's a book that will elevate your social profile.

<br>

[**Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning). A true classic, and possible one of the biggest contributions to psychology of the last century. Through his book, Viktor shares a vivid narrative of what it was like to be a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp, and how he endured and overcame the hardships focusing on love, hope, responsibility and, inner freedom. A go-to for tough times when I need to boost my resilience.

<br>

[**Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged)
It is a controversial, but revealing fiction thriller that presents a philosophical paradigm shift. The writing style, characters development and overall story make this book an enjoyable read. 
<br>
<br>

[**Flash boys, Michael Lewis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_Boys). If you have any contact with the market, this story is for you. In this non-fiction book, a group of Wall Street rebels investigate and expose the phenomenon of high-frequency trading (HFT) in the US financial market and how insiders benefitted with low risk. 
<br>

[**Factfulness, Hans Rosling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness:_Ten_Reasons_We%27re_Wrong_About_the_World_%E2%80%93_and_Why_Things_Are_Better_Than_You_Think). Together with his two collaborators, Professor Hans Rosling presents an explanation of how our instincts cause us to exaggerate situations and misperceive reality, thereby escalating problems and our response to them. As Rosling explains in his book, there are ten fundamental instincts one must fight in order to cultivate a perception based on reality, which will ultimately change the way one feels, thinks, and behaves.
