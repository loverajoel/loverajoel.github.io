# the timeless life compass

Why don’t you steal? Is it because you’re empathetic towards your victims? Or because you’re afraid of getting caught?

The answers to those questions are the principles that form your values.

Your core values are important to you and guide your life. Your principles ensure consistency with these values.

Principles shape and control behavior; they are rules and beliefs that steer life.

Principles are nouns, not verbs.

Principles are guides when uncertain or seeking answers.

Principles are boring; they don’t inspire.

Principles are nature’s laws; they can become personal guidelines.

Principles serve as foundations that help you get what you want in life.

Principles are cause and effect.

Principles enable adjustments for meaningful changes.

To create a solid life mission foundation, live by principles.
