# the timeless life compass

Do you not steal because you empathize with your victims or because you fear getting caught?

The answers to those questions are the principles that form your values.

Your core values guide your life; your principles ensure consistency.

Principles shape and control behavior; they are rules and beliefs that steer life.

Principles are nouns, not verbs.

Principles guide when uncertain or seeking answers.

Principles are boring; they don’t inspire.

Principles are nature’s laws; they can become personal guidelines.

Principles are foundations that help you achieve what you want in life.

Principles are cause and effect.

Principles enable adjustments for meaningful changes.

To create a solid life mission foundation, live by principles.
