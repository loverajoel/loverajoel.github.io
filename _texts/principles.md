# Principles

> “Practices are specific activities or actions that work in one circumstance but not necessarily in another. Principles empower everyone who understand those principles to act without constant monitoring, evaluating, correcting and controlling. Principles have universal application and when they are internalized into habits they guide people in the creation of practices that payoff with more creativity, expertise, and shared responsibility at all levels of an organization.” Stephen Covey

**Integrity:** Live your life as if it will be engraved in stone; trust in honesty and integrity. Have faith in your path.

**Healthy:** Life is once, but it’s one long experiment. Take care of it so that you can live it with energy and vitality. Exercise, eat healthily, meditate, and sleep well. Do it effortlessly by developing habits.

**Seek mastery:** Always improve and learn new things. Always question yourself and be aware of the risks you will take and your results. Don’t be afraid to fail. Stay uncomfortable. Learn from your mistakes. Fail often. Be antifragile.

**Helpfulness:**
Be the person everybody knows will be there for them when they need it. Slow down, take a deep breath, and get curious about what’s happening. 

**Quality time:** It’s what I call the time with family, friends, and your partner. Make this time count.
