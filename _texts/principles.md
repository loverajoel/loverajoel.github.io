# Principles

> “Practices are specific activities or actions that work in one circumstance but not necessarily in another. Principles empower everyone who understand those principles to act without constant monitoring, evaluating, correcting and controlling. Principles have universal application and when they are internalized into habits they guide people in the creation of practices that payoff with more creativity, expertise, and shared responsibility at all levels of an organization.” Stephen Covey

**Integrity:** Lives as if your life will be written in a rock, honor honesty and respect.  Trust in your path.

**Healthy:** Life is once, but it’s a long experiment, take care of it in order to live it with energy and vitality. Exercise, eat healthily, meditate and sleep well.  Use habits so you can do it effortlessly.

**Seek mastery:** Always be improving and learning something new, prepare for the next you in 5 years. Take risks, move fast and break things, but wisely.  Stay uncomfortable.

**Helpfulness:**  Be the person that everybody knows that you are up for them, take a breath, listen carefully, think and solve.

**Quality time:** It’s what I call the time with family, friends and your partner. Make this time count.
