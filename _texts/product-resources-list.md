# product resources list
Frequently I find myself in 1:1s with people interested in exploring or moving into Product Management. Below is a curated list of articles, podcast episodes, books and courses on Product Management that I'd recommend and consume regularly.

**NOTE:** Back in the early days of my transition to product, I curated and synthesize wiht [a friend](https://twitter.com/davidef_7) a list of must reads on [theproductindex.com](https://theproductindex.com/). Highly recommend starting from there.
