# Books
Why I share my summaries and why this section is too important?

Books are full of knowledge and wisdom. Books make our mind healthy and fit. Books inspire and stimulate the imagination.
Reading books is a great way to learn from my mentors. Books are good teachers and friends.

Writing a summary and a takeaway for each book I read is part of my book reading process.

## [Managing Oneself by Peter F Drucker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2477223.Managing_Oneself)
Successful careers are not planned. Successful careers are developed by preparing for opportunities. To succeed you need to know your strengths, how do you perform, what are your values and what you can contribute to a company/project.

### The quote
> The people who plan their second career is a minority, but they are the leaders and become role models for many. The majority “retire” with their first career and just count the rest of the days for actual retirement. These second careers help one to be focussed while having tough times during their lives and also help to contribute and make a difference.

### Takeaway
The most successful people manage themselves, determine who are, write their values and plan a second career.

## [Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard P. Rumelt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy)
Developing and implementing strategy is the central task of a leader. Bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge, is full of fluff, motivational slogans and financial goals. Many bad strategies are just statements of desire rather than plans for overcoming obstacles.
Good strategy is not just “what” you are trying to do. It is also “why” and “how” you are doing. A good strategy recognizes the nature of the challenge and offers a way of surmounting.

### The quote
> And strategy, responsive to innovation and ambition, selects the path, identifying how, why, and where leadership and determination are to be applied.

### Takeaway
Create a good strategy gives leverage over competitors and turns vision into reality.
