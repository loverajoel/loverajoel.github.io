# Books
Why I share my summaries and why this section is too important?

Books are full of knowledge and wisdom. Books make our mind healthy and fit. Books inspire and stimulate the imagination.
Reading books is a great way to learn from my mentors. Books are good teachers and friends.

Writing a summary and a takeaway for each book I read is part of my book reading process.

## [Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40672036-digital-minimalism)
Digital Minimalism  A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.

### The quote
> Cultivating a high-quality leisure life first, it will become easier to minimize low-quality digital diversions later.

### Takeaway
Use tech/online only with things that strongly support things you value.
