# questioning norms

If you’re doing things the way they have always been done, you’re always going to be playing catch-up.

What if the best methods are not the accepted ones?

Conventions might exist not because they’re the best, but because they’re familiar and go unchallenged.

In a dynamic market, clinging to traditional methods may cause you to miss innovation and differentiation opportunities.

Challenging conventional wisdom helps us determine if practices are effective or merely traditional. It forces a reevaluation of assumptions underpinning common practices. Questioning the status quo leads to rebuilding strategies and processes from scratch. 

It’s about finding innovative ways to compete, not just imitating what established incumbents do.
