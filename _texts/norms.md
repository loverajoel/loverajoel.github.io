# questioning norms

If you do things as they've always been done, you will lag behind.

The best chefs experiment with blending diverse cuisines, creating new flavors and unique dishes.

The spirit of experimentation questions the assumption that established methods are superior.

Conventions persist not because they’re the best, but because they’re familiar and unchallenged.

Sticking to traditional methods can cause you to miss opportunities for innovation and differentiation.

Challenging conventional wisdom tests the efficacy of practices beyond tradition. It prompts reevaluation of common methods.

Questioning the status quo leads to the redesign of strategies and processes.

At its core, it's about finding new paths to success, about competing in ways not yet imagined.
